The user tries to guess letters in **-** a secret word list and loses after guesses that are not in the word. The **-** user guesses a letter by clicking a button whose text is that letter. 
#### The remaining chance of guesses are calculated as follows:
**Remaining chance = Number of the characters in the word / 2**

For example;

Consider the random word is **Compression**
Remaining **chance = 11 / 2**
This is equal to **5.5**

You will **round this number as 5**
## GUI of the Game
The Game contains a menu bar that contains two menu items **File** and **Options**.
#### 1- File Menu Bar
* **New game option:** will start a new game by selecting a random word from the word database. The word file is explained below.
* **Save game option:** will save the current game. When the user selects the save game option, a file chooser appears in order to get the save file name. You will define your own save file format and save the file with *.sav extension.
* **Load game option:** will load a saved game. When the user selects load game option, a file chooser appears. In this file chooser, you will add a filter for extension. This filter will extract *.sav files from other file formats.
* **Exit option:** will quit the game, but before it will ask from user if s/he really wants to quit. Also, it's an offer to save the game.
#### 2- Options Menu Bar
* **Option:** A new frame should appear. In this frame, user can configure game properties, and it's the setting of the game.

## How to use it?
This application gets the words from a text file. This file contains **‚Äú*.db‚Äù** extension. I was free to design my own database file. However, I have put at least 20 words into the database. When the game starts, the application will **select a random** word from the database.
During gameplay, when the user clicks on one of the letters on the frame, the clicked button
**will be disabled** in order to avoid using the same letter again. This rule is also valid for
saved games. 
#### Here is an example:
Assume that the word was **Application**.
* User pressed on A letter. (This letter should become disabled.)
* User pressed on L letter. (This letter should become disabled.)
* User pressed on X letter. (This letter should become disabled.)
* User pressed on O letter. (This letter should become disabled.)
* User saved the game.
* User loaded the same game.
* At this point, A, L, X, O letters will be disabled.

If the user may guess what the word is, the application provides a text field to enter the word. If s/he is right, a dialog box appears, that indicates the player has **won the game**. Otherwise, the player has **lost the game**.
